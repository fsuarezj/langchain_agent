Fix logic orchestrator -> form_parser staying in orchestrator
Create test module to test agents

Agents:
- Get form objective
- Get sections
- Divide in questions
- Define question (type, constraint)
- Find interdependency (conditionality)
- Find gaps (other questions)
- PGI review
- Thematic experts:
    - WASH
    - LH
    - Health
    - etc.

- Data agent
    - Create xlsform
    - All questions close?

- Data Resp
    - Is there KKI Data
    - Consent
    - Risk to harm?

- Data Process
    - Understand questionnaire objective
    - Get insights
    - Get dashboard/report




TASKS:
X Create form parser for word with tables
X Test forms with gpt4
X Convert graph in an @st.cache_resource
X Fix connection with form_parser
X Review flow of graph, it always executes Orchestrator chat and later makes the decision where to go next. Now going directly to formParser, but probably need to be managed from Orchestrator as tools
X When going out of formParser doesn't overwrite the state with the parsed questionnaire
X Fix uploading after chatting
X Create initial agent to dialog with form
- Check why FormBuilder always send a questionnaire only with one question
- Create Data Agent to create xlsform
