Fix logic orchestrator -> form_parser staying in orchestrator
Create test module to test agents

Agents:
- Get form objective
- Get sections
- Divide in questions
- Define question (type, constraint)
- Find interdependency (conditionality)
- Find gaps (other questions)
- PGI review
- Thematic experts:
    - WASH
    - LH
    - Health
    - etc.

- Data agent
    - Create xlsform
    - All questions close?

- Data Resp
    - Is there KKI Data
    - Consent
    - Risk to harm?

- Data Process
    - Understand questionnaire objective
    - Get insights
    - Get dashboard/report




TASKS:
X Create form parser for word with tables
X Test forms with gpt4
X Convert graph in an @st.cache_resource
X Fix connection with form_parser
X Review flow of graph, it always executes Orchestrator chat and later makes the decision where to go next. Now going directly to formParser, but probably need to be managed from Orchestrator as tools
X When going out of formParser doesn't overwrite the state with the parsed questionnaire
X Fix uploading after chatting
X Create initial agent to dialog with forX
X Create method in Questionnaire model to create xlsform
X Make the file downloadable from streamlit
X Do not duplicate "Options" when creating choices
X Include monitor costs support for FormBuilder
- It seems there is a bug with the numeration of the questions: not doing it (number=None in the excel) or pydantic validation error
- First question after uploading, it thinks it's not uploaded
- Review pydantic data model to see if it can be improved (conditionality of fields)
- Check why FormBuilder always send a questionnaire only with one question
- Review how to manage questions individually (one agent for form and one agent to manage individual quiestons?)
- Create conditionality agent?
- Catch errors in agents output

- Review and correct output form2
- Create form parser for excel
- Test forms with gpt4 and new parser
- Create training dataset
- Fine tuning
